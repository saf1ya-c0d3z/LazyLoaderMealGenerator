```
AS A person with dietary restrictions and preferences
I WANT to be able to try new recipes that fall within my diet plan
So THAT I can stay healthy and enjoy variety in my meals.
```

## Usage
Utilizing the site is simple!

First, since there is a /corsd part of the YouTube Search Results API, you must go to the following link:
https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo
Hit the button that says "Request temporary access to the demo server"
Once the page says "You currently have temporary access to the demo server", you're good to go!
(Please do not skip this step prior to using the site, as it will not work without the temporary permission!)

Next, load our deployed application by copying and pasting the following link into a browser:
https://saf1ya-c0d3z.github.io/LazyLoaderMealGenerator/
Once the page loads, hit the "Get Started!" button.
Once on the second page, enter your personal information including your weight and your ideal weight, then click Submit.
Next, on the thrid page, enter your food preferences and dietary restrictions. and click Submit again!
Finally, you'll be presented with a personalized recipe based on your criteria, a link on how to properly cook it and a YouTube video of someone preparing the recipe (or a close approximation of the recipe) to follow along with!
Once finished, hit "Get New Recipe?" to keep your personal information and adjust your food preferences and/or dietary restrictions to get a new recipe, or hit "Start Over?" to clear all data and start over from the home page.
